## What is TNR?

Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is a program in which outdoor cats are humanely trapped, spayed or neutered, ear-tipped and returned to the location where they were found. TNR is the most humane and effective method for stabilizing and eventually reducing outdoor cat populations.

### Trap
Outdoor cats are humanely trapped by those participating in the TNR Program or volunteers assisting those who qualify for “trapping assistance”.
The traps used are humane, "TruCatch box traps."

### Neuter
The cats are spayed or neutered by a veterinarian. These surgeries are sometimes called “fixing” or “altering” a cat. The left ear is “tipped” to identify the cat as fixed. “Tipped” means that a tiny part of the ear is snipped to indicate that the cat has been altered. This procedure is performed while the cat is under anesthesia. Ear-tipping is a universal identifier of a sterilized homeless outdoor cat and helps those who are trapping cats to know that the spay/neuter has already been completed, thus avoiding subjecting the cat to a needless trapping and a second unnecessary surgical experience.

### Return

The cats are returned to their original location where caregivers may continue to provide food and water.

### Where Do Outdoor Cats Come From?
Most outdoor cats are either abandoned pets or the offspring of abandoned pets. Oftentimes, the offspring are not socialized to people.

## What are the Benefits?

- Ends the breeding cycle and stabilizes cat populations.
- More effective and less expensive than extermination.
- Eliminates or minimizes annoying behaviors such as spraying, yowling and fighting.
- Helps end the suffering of unwanted, homeless cats.
- Reduces euthanasia due to the number of cats and kittens flooding the already overburdened shelters.

### What Resources are Available to Help Me Utilize TNR?
The Animal Defense League of Arizona offers a county-wide, affordable TNR program. A donation of $25 per cat is requested. However, if you are unable to make a donation, financial assistance options are available.

### Need More Information?
The cats are returned to their original location where caregivers may continue to provide food and water.


## Our Mission and History

The Lorain TNR is a not for profit advocacy organization working to reduce the ever-growing feral cat population in the City of Lorain, Ohio.  We provide property owners with resources to implement a lost costs, long term, and nonlethal cat management program.

We assist homeowner associations, apartment complexes, mobile home parks, businesses, government offices and individuals with free roaming and stray cat populations.

The Friendship Animal Protective League generously offers “how to” presentations on the topics of trapping, how cats can be good neighbors and how to lobby and negotiate for feral cats.

### Our History

The Lorain TNR consist of a group of concerned citizens who have joined together to help control the feral cat population in our community.  We began TNR (trap, neuter, return) on our own and reached out to Friendship Animal Protective League for assistance in 2018.  They generously took us under their wing and provided us with training, use of their surgery center and equipment.  They accept and maintain incoming calls for trapping in the City of Lorain as well as any funding donations designated for our cause.    The volunteer base continues to grow and funding avenues of all kinds are being explored.  To become a member, please “like” our LORAIN TNR page on FaceBook or join our community for free online.

### Our Mission

The goal of The Lorain TNR is to educate community leaders and residents of the City of Lorain, Ohio on implementing an economically feasible method for humanely reducing the population of stray and free roaming cats, thus easing neighborhood tensions, fostering compassion, and to see abuse diminished and laws enforced.

We cannot relocate or remove cats. In the state of Arizona cats are free roaming and have the right to remain where they make their home. Removal or relocation could result in criminal or civil prosecution.
We are NOT a rescue group or shelter and cannot pick up, relocate, place OR adopt out kittens or cats.

The Lorain TNR is supported solely through donations. We do not receive any taxpayer support or other public funding. Please make a donation today and help end cat overpopulation in the City of Lorain.

## Are Outdoor Cats Driving You Crazy?

We understand. Outdoor cats can be loud, some spray and they can produce litter after litter of kittens.


### Spay/Neuter Resources
Lorain’s TNR’s initiative offers a variety of different low-cost spay/neuter resources through Trap-Neuter-Return program.

### Cat Deterrents
There are a number of items and other deterrents that can help you keep cats out of your yard and off your property.
 
### Neighbor Disputes
Struggling to co-exist with a neighbor who is caring for outdoor cats? Here are a few tips that may help you resolve your dispute.
 
### Animal Abuse
Please remember, cats are covered under the Animal Cruelty Statutes. Anyone caught harming or endangering cats can be arrested and charged with animal cruelty. If you witness or suspect animal cruelty, please follow these tips.
 
But removing them is not the best solution. By spaying/neutering outdoor cats, you can often reduce or even eliminate many of these behaviors, benefiting both you and the cats. Most importantly, spaying/neutering ends the breeding cycle and the possibility of reproduction, which in time may reduce the number of cats in your neighborhood.
 
Conversely, if you simply eliminate one outdoor cat that has not been spayed/neutered, another intact cat will likely move in to take its place and utilize the resources the first cat left behind. That leads to an endless cycle of cat after cat having litter after litter of kittens who continue to exhibit the negative behaviors that frustrate you.


## Found Kittens?

**Mom will likely return. Please don’t intervene.**

Thinking about bringing kittens to the shelter?
During kitten season, many shelters are overrun with kittens and don’t have adequate resources to care for them. Please care for them in your home until they’re 8 weeks old. The Arizona Humane Society has launched a new care-in-place program designed to make it convenient for good Samaritans to care for newborn kittens in their home. AHS will provide all the necessary tools, including care kits, vaccinations, spay/neuter surgery and training to ensure these little felines get off to a healthy start, and help you find them forever homes when they’re ready. 

When we find a litter of kittens, our good-hearted instincts tell us to rush to the aid of these fragile felines. Thankfully, human intervention is typically not required. In fact, the best thing you can do is leave the kittens alone. Mom will likely return shortly and it’s critical that the kittens remain in her care as she offers the best chance for survival. If you are extremely certain that the kittens are orphaned, you can then step in and help by caring for the kittens until they’re old enough to find homes. The chart below will help you determine what steps to take if you’ve found kittens.
